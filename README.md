# Shared GitHub Actions

This repository is a collection of [reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows) and [composite actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action), specifically designed for use in [annminn104](https://github.com/annminn104) projects.

These tools encapsulate common and repetitive tasks, allowing for easy integration into multiple projects. This approach not only reduces the need to rewrite code but also ensures standardized operations across all annminn104 repositories.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To use these workflows and actions, reference them directly from your project's workflows. Detailed instructions for each are provided below.

<br>

## üîß Composite Actions

Composite Actions are a powerful feature of GitHub Actions that allow you to create reusable actions using a combination of other actions, shell commands, or both.

This enables you to encapsulate a sequence of steps into a single action, making your workflows more modular, easier to maintain, and reducing duplication across your projects.

Composite Actions can accept inputs and use outputs, making them highly flexible and adaptable to various use cases.

Check each action's README file for detailed instructions on how to use it.

| **Action**                                                                         | **Description**                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`composer/get-cache-directory`](./actions/composer/get-cache-directory/README.md) | Gets the Composer cache directory path and exports it as env variable.                             |

## üîß Workflows

Read more about [reusing workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows).

### ‚Üí Auto Label and Release Management

#### `apply-labels.yml:`

Automatically applies labels to pull requests based on modified paths.

This workflow triages pull requests and applies labels based on the paths that are modified in the pull request. This can help to categorize your pull requests and make it easier to identify the type of changes included.

To use this workflow, set up a `.github/labeler.yml` file with your configuration in your project. For more information on how to configure the labeler, see: <https://github.com/actions/labeler/blob/master/README.md>

Here is an example of how to use this workflow:

<details>
<summary><code>.github/workflows/apply-labels.yml</code></summary>

```yaml
---

on:
  pull_request:

name: üè∑Ô∏è Add labels

jobs:
  label:
    uses: annminn104/gh-actions/.github/workflows/apply-labels.yml@master
    with:
      os: ubuntu-latest
    secrets:
      token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

...
```

</details>
<details>
<summary><code>.github/labeler.yml</code></summary>

```yaml
---

"type: bug":
    - head-branch: ['^bug', '^fix', 'bug', 'fix']

"type: enhancement":
    - head-branch: ['^feature', '^feat', 'feature']

"type: documentation":
    - changed-files:
          - any-glob-to-any-file: ['assets/**/*', '.github/*', './*.md']

"type: maintenance":
    - changed-files:
          - any-glob-to-any-file: ['tests/**/*', '.github/workflows/*']

...
```

</details>

#### `auto-merge-release.yml:`

This workflow automatically merges releases. This workflow utilizes [peter-evans/enable-pull-request-automerge](https://github.com/peter-evans/enable-pull-request-automerge) to auto-merge releases that are created by [googleapis/release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please).

Here is an example of how to use this workflow:

<details>
<summary><code>.github/workflows/auto-merge-release.yml</code></summary>

      token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_GITHUB_TOKEN }}

...
```

</details>

<br>

#### `create-changesets-release.yml:`

This workflow creates a release based on changesets. This workflow utilizes [changesets/action](https://github.com/changesets/action) to create a release based on changesets.

Here is an example of how to use this workflow:

<details>
<summary><code>.github/workflows/create-changesets-release.yml</code></summary>

```yaml
---

            repository: annminn104/repository-name
        secrets:
            # to trigger other workflows, pass PAT token instead of GITHUB_TOKEN
            token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            npm_token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}

...
```

Example repositories, using this workflow:

- [annminn104/docker-node](https://github.com/annminn104/docker-node)

**Build image with "release" tag:**

<details>
<summary><code>.github/workflows/build-release.yml</code></summary>

```yaml

...
```

</details>

### ‚Üí Code Architecture

#### `create-arch-diagram.yml:`

This workflow leverages the [codesee-io/codesee-action](https://github.com/Codesee-io/codesee-action) action to automatically generate architecture diagrams for your codebase whenever a pull request is made.

CodeSee is an open-source tool that helps visualize your codebase and its dependencies, making it easier for new contributors to understand the project or for maintaining a clear view of your project's architecture over time.

Here is an example of how to use this workflow:

<details>
<summary><code>.github/workflows/create-arch-diagram.yml</code></summary>

```yaml

    branches:
      - develop
  pull_request_target:
    types:
      - opened
      - synchronize
      - reopened

name: ü§ñ CodeSee

permissions: read-all

jobs:

    with:
      os: ubuntu-latest
      continue-on-error: true
    secrets:
      codesee-token: ${{ secrets.CODESEE_ARCH_DIAG_API_TOKEN }}

...
```

</details>

### ‚Üí Static Analysis

#### `shellcheck.yml:`

This workflow uses [redhat-plumbers-in-action/differential-shellcheck](https://github.com/redhat-plumbers-in-action/differential-shellcheck) to run shell script analysis.

Here is an example of how to use this workflow:

<details>
<summary><code>.github/workflows/shellcheck.yml</code></summary>

```yaml
---

on:  # yamllint disable-line rule:truthy
  pull_request:
